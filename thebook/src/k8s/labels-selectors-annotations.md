# Labels, Selectors, Annotations

## Labels
### Needed for gluing k8s resources together
For instance, a `deployment` resource must define a label in its pod template metadata, so that a `service` resource can select pods by-label for routing traffic to them.

### Handy for getting organized - querying diverse k8s resources by-custom-label
For instance, a `pod` resource might belong to several categories of label:
```
labels:
  app: guestbook
  tier: backend
  role: master
  environment: qa
```
You can query pods by-label like this:
```
# -l <query> - this one shows pods in production AND qa environments;
# -Lrole displays value of ROLE label as a column in the output
#
$ k get pods -l 'environment in (production,qa)' -Lrole
```
- Label prefixes (`some-prefix/some-label`) are optional.  Handy for avoiding naming conflicts
- Label values can be empty
- Total length must be 64 chars or less


## Selectors
[Some Kubernetes objects, such as services and replicationcontrollers, also use label selectors to specify sets of other resources, such as pods.](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#set-references-in-api-objects)

Below is an example of a service selecting a pod by its `my-app` app label.
```
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
...

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
```

## Annotations
Annotations, unlike labels, are NOT used for resources queries.

## matchLabels, matchExpressions
For specifying set-based requirements in selectors.  Supported by newer resources (but not by `Service`, which supports [only equality-based selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#service-and-replicationcontroller)).

## Labels and Selectors in Deployment manifests
Looking at deployment yaml, there are three different `labels` sections.  Their content often tends to be similar or identical, so it's puzzling why they live in so many places.  What are their purposes?  (This explanation is inspired by a helpful [goglides.dev](https://www.goglides.dev/bkpandey/matchlabels-labels-and-selectors-in-deployment-5fk1) post).

Consider this snippet of a typical Deployment yaml:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  ...
  labels:
    app: my-web-app
    app_env: development
  name: the-web-app
  namespace: the-web-app-ns
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-web-app
      app_env: development
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-web-app
        app_env: development
    spec:
      containers:
      ...
```
`labels` sections live in three places in a Deployment yaml:
1. metadata.labels
2. spec.selector.matchLabels
3. spec.template.metadata.labels

### Deployment metadata.labels
The deployment's metadata.labels support operations that want to select that deployment; for instance, querying with the `-l` flag to delete a deployment returned by the query.

### Deployment spec.selector.matchLabels
A deployment uses its `matchLabels` selector to find the pods itâ€™s responsible for managing.  If no pods with those labels when the deployment is first created, the deployment will do nothing. But if there are, the deployment will manage those pods.

### Deployment spec.template.metadata.labels
The deployment uses the pod template, including its metadata.labels, to create pods that can be selected by a service for routing traffic.
